# Runcket

Runcket is a game where you navigate through a cave while being chased by big blob of deadly lava. 

Basic concept about flying rocket and avoiding obstacles came from one of the projects
I did during unity course. 

In it's first iteration game was based about successfully flying from point A to point B.
With idea of redesigning it, I decided to change core gameplay to endless level as
I also wanted to implement procedural level generation. 

Also inspired by flappy bird I wanted to balance it as a rage-game,
where you can easily die and get player into a state where you want to repeat and beat your score and advance even further in a game.

# Core mechanics

Lava - big chunk of lava is constantly chasing player which forces you to keep up proper flying pace.

Obstacles - you touch them = you die

Fuel - flying with your pod uses fuel which can be refilled by collecting fuel batteries.

Procedural level generation - different parts are randomly selected to create infinite gameplay.
